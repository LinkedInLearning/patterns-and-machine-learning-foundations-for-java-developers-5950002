## Course Description

In this course, explore the exciting world of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) from a Java developerâ€™s perspective. Start with the essential principles of AI/ML and why patterns are so important. Learn how to differentiate between AI, ML, and deep learning, and clearly understand predictive AI versus generative AI. Join instructor Frank Greco to build a solid foundation on how to use ML in your software development projects and processes effectively.

## Notes

These files can be easily built once you specify an API key from a GenAI provider, eg, OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, et al.  You should specify your API key as an environment variable in the IDE's runtime configuration options.
For example in IntelliJ,

Run->[Edit Configurations]->[Environment variables]->   OPENAI_API_KEY=....

## DogIdentifier JSR381 App

Due to image licensing restrictions, we cannot include the dog images that we used from the open-source [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).

Here are the steps for you to download/install the images.

Copy the [Chihuahua images](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/n02085620.html) from the Stanford Dogs Dataset
and put the images into the ./training_data/DogImages2/train/000.Chihuahua folder.  In the 000.Negative folder, you can put approximately the same number of non-Chihuahua images.  The Kaggle Computer Vision datasets are useful, for example [Food](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=food&tags=13207-Computer+Vision) or [Cars](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=cars&tags=13207-Computer+Vision).  You should make sure the training data is non-biased by having a similar number of images.
